 The reason we're doing is that you can't write an infinite amount of bytes into a pipe.
 On some platforms, the limit is fairly high; on other platforms, the limit is infuriatingly small
 (looking at you, Windows). To counteract this, we need to read in a goroutine from one end of
 the pipe and return the result across a channel.
